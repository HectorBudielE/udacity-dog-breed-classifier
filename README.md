# Dog-breed Classifier

## Project Overview

This project is based on the [Dog-Breed Classifier repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification) for the [Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

It includes building a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/HectorBudielE/udacity-dog-breed-classifier.git
		cd udacity-dog-breed-classifier
	```

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages` (the path can be changed within the notebook).  The `dogImages/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.

3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw` (the path can be changed within the notebook).  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. 
4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the README in the program repository.
5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the steps.
	
	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```

__NOTE:__ In the notebook, you will need to train CNNs in PyTorch.  If your CNN is taking too long to train, feel free to pursue one of the options under the section __Accelerating the Training Process__ below.

### Contents

- Intro
- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dog
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Write Your Algorithm
- Step 6: Test Your Algorithm


## (Optionally) Accelerating the Training Process 

If your code is taking too long to run, you will need to either reduce the complexity of your chosen CNN architecture or switch to running your code on a GPU.  If you'd like to use a GPU, you can spin up an instance of your own:

#### Amazon Web Services

You can use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money)

#### Google Colab

You can run this notebook in Google Colab for free. You have to be careful about the access of the extracted data in the notebook.
